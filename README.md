# Battle Chess Spec

## Intro

Chess takes place on an 8x8 board. Two equal teams, white and black, take turns moving one piece per turn. The game ends when the king is left with no possible moves that don't result in the king being in check. This is called a "checkmate". See [the rules of chess](https://www.chesscentral.com/pages/first-moves-in-chess/the-rules-of-chess.html) for details.
